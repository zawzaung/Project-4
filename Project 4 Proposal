Project 4 Proposal

Yelp is the go-to place for reviews when you want to explore new eateries.  However, its star rating only conveys the overall experience at the restaurants.  You would need to read through the reviews if you want to learn more about the food quality, customer service, place cleanliness, or wait time.  For restaurant owners, in-depth understanding of customer reviews will help them recognize where they need improvements.  By leveraging the power of NLP, we can gain more insight into the reasons behind each particular star rating from the reviews.  

For this project, I plan to scrape yelp reviews of a restaurant and perform aspect-based sentiment analysis to determine the customersâ€™ sentiments in regard to the food quality, customer service, etc.
